# Plan for Neovim Plugin: Markdown Slides Integration

## Goal

This document outlines the plan for designing and developing a Neovim plugin that seamlessly integrates with an existing React-based shared library for markdown slides. The plugin will allow users to manage and potentially control presentations directly from Neovim, leveraging the power of the shared library for rendering and displaying the slides.

## Purpose of This Plan

These markdown files serve as a comprehensive guide and thought process for the plugin's creation. Each file will break down a specific aspect of the plugin's architecture, functionality, and development considerations.

## Structure of the Plan

This plan is organized into the following documents within this directory:

1.  **`01-neovim-plugin-basics.md`**: Covers the fundamental concepts of Neovim plugin development relevant to this project.
2.  **`02-plugin-structure.md`**: Details the proposed file and directory structure for the plugin itself.
3.  **`03-react-library-integration.md`**: Explains the strategy for how the Neovim plugin will communicate with and control the React-based slides library (likely running as a separate Node.js process).
4.  **`04-autoloaded-core-logic.md`**: Describes the core functions and logic of the plugin, likely to be implemented in autoloaded Vimscript or Lua modules.
5.  **`05-ux-workflow.md`**: Discusses the intended user experience and workflow when using the plugin.
6.  **`06-plugin-documentation.md`**: Outlines the structure and content for the plugin's user documentation (`doc/` directory).
7.  **`07-packaging-distribution.md`**: Considers how the plugin will be packaged and distributed for users.

By following this structured plan, we aim to develop a robust and user-friendly Neovim plugin.
